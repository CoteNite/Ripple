## Product Overview

**Ripple** is a desktop RSS/Atom reader designed for personal knowledge management and continuous information tracking. It combines feed management, article reading, notes, tags, search, export, AI summaries, AI translation, and RAG-based Q&A in one local-first reading workspace.

Ripple supports Windows and macOS desktop usage. Subscriptions, articles, notes, tags, and AI usage records are stored in a local SQLite database. AI providers can be configured through OpenAI-compatible APIs or local model services such as Ollama and vLLM.

## Technical Architecture

| Layer | Technology |
| --- | --- |
| Desktop | Electron |
| Frontend | Vue 3, Vite, Element Plus, Pinia, Vue Router |
| Backend | FastAPI, Python |
| Database | SQLite |
| Packaging | Electron Builder, PyInstaller |
| AI Integration | OpenAI-compatible API, Ollama, vLLM, local embedding services |

When the desktop app starts, Ripple launches a local backend service automatically and connects the frontend to the local API. Installed Windows builds keep all persistent user state inside the selected installation directory; macOS, Linux and development runs retain their existing data locations.

## Installation

### Windows

1. Download the latest `Ripple Setup x.x.x.exe` from `release/` or GitHub Releases.
2. Run the installer as the current user and choose a writable dedicated directory on a local fixed disk. Other drive letters, Unicode and spaces are supported; network paths, removable disks and mixed-content directories are rejected.
3. Launch **Ripple** from the desktop shortcut or Start Menu.
4. Configure an LLM provider in AI Settings if AI features are needed.

Windows current state lives in `ripple-data/` under the installation directory. On first launch, recognized legacy data for the same Windows user is migrated only when no valid current dataset exists. The database, persistent reader preferences and `ripple-migration-backup/` are verified before migrated source files are cleaned up. Failures preserve the source and stop startup; existing valid data always takes precedence without merging.

Upgrades keep the registered directory, user data and migration backup. Interactive uninstall defaults to keeping data; deletion requires an explicit choice and only runs when uninstall actually starts. Silent uninstall always preserves data. Reinstalling in the same directory resumes retained state; a different directory does not automatically move data from the previous installation. Independent exports are preserved. Credentials remain tied to the same user and computer; copying the directory is not a supported cross-computer migration.

Storage failures are reported rather than silently selecting another data location. Restore access to the original directory before restarting. Migration backups retain pre-migration state; no backup-restoration UI is included.

If an upgrade is interrupted after the previous program is removed, rerun the installer: it restores verified protected content to the original directory before continuing. Incoming program-path collisions with independent files stop installation before overwriting them. Do not delete the sibling `.ripple-upgrade-transaction` directory while recovery is pending.

### macOS

1. Download the latest `Ripple-x.x.x.dmg` from GitHub Releases.
2. Open the `.dmg` file.
3. Drag **Ripple** into the `Applications` folder.
4. Launch Ripple from Launchpad or `Applications`.
5. If macOS blocks the app, allow it in `System Settings -> Privacy & Security`.

## Local Development

### Requirements

| Tool | Recommended Version |
| --- | --- |
| Node.js | 18+ |
| npm | 9+ |
| Python | 3.10+ |
| Git | 2.40+ |

### Install Dependencies

```powershell
npm install
npm install --prefix frontend
python -m venv .venv1
.\.venv1\Scripts\Activate.ps1
pip install -r backend\requirements.txt
```

### Start Desktop Development Mode

```powershell
npm run dev:desktop
```

This command starts:

| Service | Default Behavior |
| --- | --- |
| Vite frontend | `http://127.0.0.1:5173` |
| FastAPI backend | Automatically selects a local port |
| Electron desktop app | Loads the frontend and connects to the backend |

### Start Web Frontend and Backend Separately

```powershell
cd backend
uvicorn app.main:app --reload
```

```powershell
cd frontend
npm run dev
```

## Packaging and Deployment

### Windows Installer

```powershell
npm run dist:desktop
```

The installer will be generated at:

```text
release/Ripple Setup x.x.x.exe
```

The Windows package includes:

| Component | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Electron Shell | Desktop runtime |
| Vue frontend build | `frontend/dist` |
| PyInstaller backend | Bundled FastAPI backend |
| SQLite user data | Created automatically after installation |

### macOS DMG

Run the following on macOS:

```bash
npm install
npm install --prefix frontend
python3 -m venv .venv1
source .venv1/bin/activate
pip install -r backend/requirements.txt
npm run dist:desktop
```

The DMG file will be generated at:

```text
release/Ripple-x.x.x.dmg
```

macOS packaging notes:

| Item | Description |
| --- | --- |
| Build platform | Build the DMG on macOS whenever possible. |
| Python backend | Bundled with PyInstaller and shipped with the app. |
| Signing and notarization | Recommended for public distribution. |
| First launch warning | Unsigned builds may require manual approval in Privacy & Security settings. |

## AI Configuration

Open **AI Settings** in the app to configure:

| Configuration | Purpose |
| --- | --- |
| General AI Provider | Used for summaries, AI tag suggestions, and RAG Chat. |
| Translation Provider | Used for article translation and comparison reading. |
| Embedding Settings | Used for the RAG article index. |

Supported provider types:

| Type | Example |
| --- | --- |
| OpenAI-compatible | OpenAI, DeepSeek-compatible services, TokenHub-compatible services |
| vLLM Local | `http://127.0.0.1:8001/v1` |
| Ollama | `http://127.0.0.1:11434/v1` |
| Custom | Custom compatible endpoint |

API keys are encrypted locally. When editing a provider, leaving the API Key field empty keeps the existing key unchanged.

## Data and Privacy

| Data | Storage |
| --- | --- |
| Feeds, articles, notes, tags | Local SQLite database |
| AI provider settings | Local database with encrypted keys |
| AI usage logs | Local database |
| Exported files | User-selected local path |

Ripple is local-first by default. Reading data is only sent to external AI services when the user explicitly configures and uses a third-party AI provider.

## Troubleshooting

| Issue | Suggested Action |
| --- | --- |
| Feed sync fails | Check whether the Feed URL is reachable and review sync logs. |
| AI summary or translation fails | Verify Base URL, model name, API Key, and proxy settings. |
| RAG Q&A has no answer | Build the article index before asking questions. |
| Windows icon does not refresh | Reinstall the latest build and remove old desktop shortcuts if needed. |
| macOS blocks the app | Allow it in Privacy & Security settings, or use a signed build. |
